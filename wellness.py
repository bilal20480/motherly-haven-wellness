Present this schedule in a clean table format, where each row represents a day and columns show activities for each time slot. Include gentle and supportive activities such as pelvic stretches, hydration reminders, prenatal vitamins, mindful walking, meditation, light chores, journaling, bonding time, and balanced meal suggestions. Ensure all activities are safe, calming, and appropriate for a pregnant woman (assume she is in the second trimester unless otherwise noted). After the table, add a short, uplifting paragraph that describes how the woman might feel emotionally during the day â€” supported, calm, and hopeful. Avoid headings, introductions, or extra explanations â€” just return the table and the emotional narrative."""
